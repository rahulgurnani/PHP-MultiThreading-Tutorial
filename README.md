# PHP-MultiThreading-Tutorial
In this repo., I share my experiments with pthreads in php and results.
I have implemented a for loop which just adds numbers. You can modify the numberOfThreads to see the variations. I worked on a 4 core machine and reduced the run time to about 50%.

# Installation
Found this tutorial helpful for php 5, take care to install pthread-2.0.9 (latest one is not compatible with php5).  http://eddmann.com/posts/compiling-php-5-5-with-zts-and-pthreads-support/ 

This git gist was helpful in understanding the concepts well :
